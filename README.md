2D-Galaxy-Shooter
Welcome to the project set up section we will cover installing unity and setting up our project for a 2D game.

You're also going to learn how to activate and use the team Kolob service provided by unity for Source Control Team Club amazing the ability to work with other developers and save time on your game by saving it to the cloud.

You would then create what are called commits which can be thought of as published changes to your game.

Will continue on and install the required assets from the asset store needed to set up our galaxy background.

We'll end this section by applying a Shater that would transform our game background to an awesome intergalactic


stage for a space shooter.
